# RMRK Substrate

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

> **Warning**: No stability and security guarantees. Not production ready.

Additional documentation [https://rmrk-team.github.io/rmrk-substrate](https://rmrk-team.github.io/rmrk-substrate)

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### RPC

The RMRK RPC description can be found in [RPC docs](https://rmrk-team.github.io/rmrk-substrate/#/rpc)

The RPC is declared in the `rmrk-rpc` crate.

The Runtime implements the RPC API in the `runtime/src/lib.rs` inside the `impl_runtime_apis` macro.
The node exposes the RPC interface described in the `rpc.md`. The RPC interface implementation passes each RPC call to the RMRK runtime API. The RPC interface declaration and implementation can be found in the file `node/src/rpc.rs`.

### Integration Tests

The Integration Tests are located in the `tests/src` directory. They use the RPC interface to fetch data from the node.

- All transactions used in the tests are located in `tests/src/util/tx.ts`.
- All "fetch" functions like `getNft` are located in `tests/src/util/fetch.ts`. Here you can see an example of the RPC interface usage.
- All "helper" functions are located in `tests/src/util/helpers.ts`.
- Type augmentation located in `tests/src/interfaces`, **autogenerated**, a lot of lines of code :)

##### How to start the tests

```console
# (In the rmrk-substrate directory)

# Run the node
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp

# (In another terminal)
# Start the tests
cd tests && yarn test
```

Instead of running all the tests at once, you can run a separate test if you like.
For instance, you can type `yarn testSendNft` to run the `tests/src/sendNft.test.ts` test.

All the tests have the following name pattern: `<test-name>.test.ts`. To run a separate test you can type the following: `yarn test<test-name>`

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/rmrk-substrate -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/rmrk-substrate --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/rmrk-substrate purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/rmrk-substrate -ldebug --dev
```

### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-end

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click
here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your
local node template.

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network.
Substrate-based blockchain nodes expose a number of capabilities:

- Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking stack to allow the
  nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
- Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
  [consensus](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/consensus) on the state of the
  network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines and also ships with
  several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top of
  [Web3 Foundation research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
- RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate nodes.

There are several files in the `node` directory - take special note of the following:

- [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs): A
  [chain specification](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/chain-specs) is a
  source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications
  are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a
  production chain. Take note of the `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions, which
  are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These
  functions identify some
  [well-known accounts](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys)
  and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
- [`service.rs`](./node/src/service.rs): This file defines the node implementation. Take note of
  the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular,
  there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the
  [longest chain rule](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/consensus#longest-chain-rule),
  the [Aura](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/consensus#aura) block authoring
  mechanism and the
  [GRANDPA](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/consensus#grandpa) finality
  gadget.

After the node has been [built](#build), refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the
capabilities and configuration parameters that it exposes:

```shell
./target/release/rmrk-substrate --help
```

### Runtime

In Substrate, the terms
"[runtime](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/glossary#runtime)" and
"[state transition function](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/glossary#state-transition-function-stf)"
are analogous - they refer to the core logic of the blockchain that is responsible for validating
blocks and executing the state changes they define. The Substrate project in this repository uses
the [FRAME](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame) framework to construct a
blockchain runtime. FRAME allows runtime developers to declare domain-specific logic in modules
called "pallets". At the heart of FRAME is a helpful
[macro language](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/macros) that makes it easy to
create pallets and flexibly compose them to create blockchains that can address
[a variety of needs](https://www.substrate.io/substrate-users/).

Review the [FRAME runtime implementation](./runtime/src/lib.rs) included in this template and note
the following:

- This file configures several pallets to include in the runtime. Each pallet configuration is
  defined by a code block that begins with `impl $PALLET_NAME::Config for Runtime`.
- The pallets are composed into a single runtime by way of the
  [`construct_runtime!`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/macro.construct_runtime.html)
  macro, which is part of the core
  [FRAME Support](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame#support-crate)
  library.

### Pallets

The runtime in this project is constructed using many FRAME pallets that ship with the
[core Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame) and a
template pallet that is [defined in the `pallets`](./pallets/template/src/lib.rs) directory.

A FRAME pallet is compromised of a number of blockchain primitives:

- Storage: FRAME defines a rich set of powerful
  [storage abstractions](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/storage) that makes
  it easy to use Substrate's efficient key-value database to manage the evolving state of a
  blockchain.
- Dispatchables: FRAME pallets define special types of functions that can be invoked (dispatched)
  from outside of the runtime in order to update its state.
- Events: Substrate uses [events and errors](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/events-and-errors)
  to notify users of important changes in the runtime.
- Errors: When a dispatchable fails, it returns an error.
- Config: The `Config` configuration interface is used to define the types and parameters upon
  which a FRAME pallet depends.
