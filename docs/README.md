# RMRK Substrate Pallets

## Main features

- NFTs owning NFTs
- NFTs having multiple priority-ordered client-dependent resources (a book with a cover and an audio
  version)
- NFTs with conditional rendering (on-NFT logic allowing different visuals and resources to trigger
  depending on on-chain and off-chain conditions).
- NFTs governed as DAOs via shareholder tokens (issue commands to NFTs democratically)
- NFTs, accounts, and other on-chain entities being emoted to (on-chain emotes), allowing early
  price discovery without listing, selling, bidding.

## Overview

Initial implementation extends [Substrate Uniques](https://github.com/peaqnetwork/substrate.git/tree/master/frame/uniques) pallet as 'low level' NFT dependency.
Mechanics and interactions are based on [RMRK 2 standard](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-spec/tree/master/standards/rmrk2.0.0)
